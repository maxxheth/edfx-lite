                <p>During the first phase, we create a live mockup site using raw HTML &amp; CSS that you can visit in
                    real time and
                    interact with. And if you already have a design in PSD format, we can gladly convert that into an
                    HTML &amp; CSS
                    site.</p>

                <p>And if you have no idea what HTML &amp; CSS are, just think of HTML as the building blocks for a site
